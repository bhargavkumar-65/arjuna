Purpose
-------

Driving an automated test with data is a critical feature in test automation frameworks.

Here, we will explore various flexible options available in Arjuna for data driven testing.

You can supply **drive_with** argument to the **@test** decorator to instruct Arjuna to associate a **Data Source** with a test. Depending on the needs, as described below, you use Arjuna's markup for different types of data sources.

Single **data record**
----------------------

Sometimes, the need is simple. You have a single data record, but want to separate it from the test code for the sake of clarity.

This need is solved with the **record** markup of Arjuna. You can provide any number of positional or named arugments.

.. code-block:: python

    from arjuna import *

    @test(drive_with=record(1, True, a='something', b='anything'))
    def check_pos_data(request, data):
        pass

1. We provide **drive_with** argument to the **@test** decorator.
2. To specify a single data record, we call the **record** factory function.
3. **record** can take any number of positional or keyword arguments.
4. The signature of the test now contains a **data** argument.
5. Within the body of the tests, you access the positional values using indices (e.g. **data[0]**)
6. You can retrieve named values using a dictionary syntax (e.g. **data['a']**) or dot syntax (e.g. **data.a**).
7. Names are case-insensitive. **data['a']**, **data['A']**, **data.a** and **data.A** mean the same thing.

**Multiple Data Records**
-------------------------

You use the **records** factory function to provide multiple records. It can contain any number of **record** entries. The test will be repeated as many times as the number of records (2 in this example.)

.. code-block:: python

    from arjuna import *

    @test(drive_with=
        records(
            record(1,2,sum=3),
            record(4,5,sum=9),
        )
    )
    def check_records(request, data):
        pass

The report will contain separate entries for each test. The name will indicate the data used. (e.g. **test/module/check_04_dd_records.py::check_records[Data-> Indexed:[7, 8] Named:{sum=10}]**)

Retrieval of data values is done exactly the same way as in case of a single data record.


Driving with Static **Data Function**
-------------------------------------

Rather than including static data in Python code, one might want to generate data or pull data from an external service to create data records.

A simple way to achieve this is to write a data function. A static data function always behaves in the same manner.

.. code-block:: python

    @test(drive_with=data_function(func))
    def check_static_data_func(request, data):
        pass

We use **data_function** factory function to associate the data function with the test function Retrieval of values is same as earlier.

Driving with Static Data Generator
----------------------------------

You can also use a Python generator instead of a normal function:

.. code-block:: python

    @test(drive_with=data_function(data_generator))
    def check_generator_func(request, data):
        pass

Driving with Dynamic Data Function or Generator
-----------------------------------------------

Another advanced measure that you can take is creating a data function which acts on the arguments supplied by you to govern the data it returns/generates.

.. code-block:: python

    from arjuna import *

    @test(drive_with=data_function(dynamic_data_func, 8, "something", a="whatever", b=1))
    def check_dynamic_data_func(request, data):
        pass

Data functions can take any number of arguments - positional as well as named. You supply the arguments in the **data_function** builder function to control the data function.

Driving with Static **Data Classes**
------------------------------------

Instead of a function, you can also represent your data generation logic as a data class. The Data Class must implement Python's Iteration Protocol. A static data class always behaves in the same manner.


.. code-block:: python

    @test(drive_with=data_class(MyDataClass))
    def check_data_class(request, data):
        pass

We use **data_class** factory function to associate the data class with the test function. Retrieval of values is same as earlier.

Driving with Dynamic Data Classes
---------------------------------

Another advanced measure that you can take is creating a data class which acts on the arguments supplied by you to govern the data it generates.

.. code-block:: python

    from arjuna import *

    @test(drive_with=data_class(MyDataClass, 8, "something", a="whatever", b=1))
    def check_dynamic_data_class(request, data):
        pass

Data classes can take any number of arguments - positional as well as named. You supply the arguments in the **data_class** factory function to control the data class.

Driving with **Data Files**
---------------------------

For large, static data it might be useful to externalize the data completely outside of Python code.

Arjuna supports data externalization in XLS, TSV/CSV and INI files out of the box.

You can use **data_file** factory function to specify a data file. Arjuna determines the loader based on the file extension.

The files are automatically picked up from **Data Sources directory** which is **<Project Root>/data/source**.

Driving with Excel File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An excel data file (.xls file) can contain data in following format. (.xlsx files are NOT supported as of now)

.. image:: _static/inputxls.png

.. code-block:: python

    from arjuna import *

    @test(drive_with=data_file("input.xls"))
    def check_drive_with_excel(request, data):
        pass

Driving with Delimiter Separated File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An delimiter-separated data file can contain data in following format. The delim 

**.txt**

.. code-block::

   Left	Right	Sum
   1	2	3
   4	5	8

**.csv**

.. code-block::

   Left,Right,Sum
   1,2,3
   4,5,8

.. code-block:: python

    from arjuna import *

    @test(drive_with=data_file("input.txt"))
    def check_drive_with_tsv(request, data):
        pass

    @test(drive_with=data_file("input.csv", delimiter=","))
    def check_drive_with_csv(request, data):
        pass

Default delimiter is **tab**. If you use any other delimiter, you can pass it as **delimiter** argument.

Driving with INI File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An INI data file can contain data in following format.

.. code-block:: ini

   [Record 1]
   Left = 1
   Right = 2
   Sum = 3
   
   [Record 2]
   Left = 4
   Right = 5
   Sum = 8

.. code-block:: python

    from arjuna import *

    @test(drive_with=data_file("input.ini"))
    def check_drive_with_ini(request, data):
        pass

Data Files with Exclude Filter for Records
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At times, you might want to selectively mark records in data files to be excluded from consideration.

You can do this by adding a column named **exclude** and set it to **y/yes/true** to exclude a record.

For delimiter-separated-files, you can also comment a record by putting a **#** at the beginning.

For INI files, you can also comment a complete record by using **;** which is the commenting symbol for INI files.

Driving with **Multiple Data Sources**
--------------------------------------

You can associate multiple data sources with a single test in Arjuna.

We can achieve this by using the **many_data_sources** factory function.

.. code-block:: python

    from arjuna import *

    @test(drive_with=many_data_sources(
        record(left=1, right=2, sum=3),
        records(
            record(left=3, right=4, sum=7),
            record(left=7, right=8, sum=10)
        ),
        data_function(myrange),
        data_class(MyDataClass),
        data_file("input.xls")
    ))
    def check_drive_with_many_sources(request, data):
        pass

The data sources are picked up sequentially with this construct.
